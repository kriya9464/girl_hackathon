1. At first define the circuit file of txt format with all the required nodes and their equations.
2. Variable name used to represent inputs should be A, B, C, D . As the algorithm is designed for these names only.
3. If you want to try for other new circuits then either create one new circuit file or replace the data in the previous circuit file with new data but do no append in the same file.
4. Now, to use this circuit_file.txt in code, place it's name in the code in faults.cpp file where it is needed so that code can read the file and perform the required operations.
5. After running the code it will ask the input for fault_at (node at which fault is present) and fault_type (SA0 or SA1). Provide these values for further operation.
6. The output will be printed in the output.txt file.
